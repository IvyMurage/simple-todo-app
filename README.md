# Simple todo app

I built this todo app to familirize myself with react concepts such as hooks. Some of the hooks that I used were:
* useReducer to manage my todos state
* useContext to manage my state and dispatch globally, this enable me to use my dispatch option in different parts my application
* useState to manage state locally within my component.
  
## As user:
* You can create a todo
* Update a todo based on category and description
* Filter todos
* Delete a todo
* Search for a todo
